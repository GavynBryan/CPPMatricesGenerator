# CPPMatricesGenerator
Personal utility for creating an empty C++ matrix of a custom dimension.
If your main goal is to create an empty matrix full of zeroes, then you'd best automate that within your C++ code. This script is intended for people who need to hardcode and modify large matrices, often for experimental reasons or for small applications where parsing data from another file is just too much of a hassle. Also, I guess it technically works with C as well.
